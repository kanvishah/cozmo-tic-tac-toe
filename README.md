# Playing Tic Tac Toe with Cozmo! 

By Kanvi Shah

Project Description: 
Using the cozmo python SDK, this project provides an interactive and physical 
environment for a human user to play tic tac toe with a robot. The game will occur 
on paper, with the board drawn in front of the players. In order to make a move, 
Cozmo will move to the spot on the board that he wishes to place his X or O and display 
this on his screen. The user interacts with a GUI to make moves, which Cozmo will then
also draw out.

To play, user must download "cozmo-tictactoe.py" and "algorithms.py" into the same directory. 
To set up the physical board, places three light cubes around the edges according to folllowing instructions:

1: Cube with "paper clip" should go in the top left corner.

2: Cube with the "lamp" or "heart" should go in the bottom left corner.

3: Cube with characters that look like "ab" should go in thee top right corner.

To run, use terminal to launch the cozmo-tictactoe.py file.

The cozmo python SDK is needed for this project.
